    <h1>Project 1: Automated Purchase Order Sharing</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of this project is to create a web application that automates the process of sharing purchase orders (POs) stored in a Google Sheet with relevant stakeholders. This automation will streamline the PO approval and distribution process, making it more efficient and error-free.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Sheets Integration: The application will integrate with a Google Sheet that contains the list of purchase orders to be shared.</li>
            <li>User Authentication: Users will be required to log in using their credentials to access the application. User authentication will help ensure that only authorized personnel can access and share POs.</li>
            <li>PO Selection: Users can select specific POs from the Google Sheet that they want to share. The application will display a list of available POs, allowing users to choose the ones they need.</li>
            <li>Recipient Management: Users can specify the recipients for each selected PO. The application will allow users to add, edit, or remove recipient email addresses.</li>
            <li>Email Notifications: Once the user confirms the recipients, the application will automatically generate and send email notifications to each recipient. The emails will include a link to access the shared PO, and they can be customized with a message or additional information.</li>
            <li>Dashboard and Notifications: Users will have access to a dashboard where they can track the status of shared POs. Notifications will be sent to users when recipients open or interact with the shared POs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Front-End:</strong> HTML, CSS: For the user interface and styling. JavaScript: For handling user interactions and making API requests.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Back-End:</strong> Node.js (Optional): To build a server for user authentication and handling API requests. Google Sheets API: To interact with the Google Sheet containing PO data. Email API (e.g., SendGrid, Gmail API): To send email notifications.
        </p>

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Efficiency: Automating the PO sharing process reduces manual effort and minimizes the risk of errors associated with manual data entry and email distribution.</li>
            <li>Transparency: Users can track the status of shared POs in real-time, improving transparency and accountability in the procurement process.</li>
            <li>Customization: The application can be customized to fit the specific needs and workflows of the organization.</li>
            <li>Accessibility: Authorized users can access and share POs from anywhere with an internet connection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Integration: Ensuring seamless integration with Google Sheets and email services may require careful API implementation.</li>
            <li>Security: Protecting user data and maintaining the security of sensitive purchase order information is crucial.</li>
            <li>User Experience: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface is important for user adoption.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The Automated Purchase Order Sharing system will streamline the process of sharing purchase orders, making it more efficient and less error-prone. By leveraging web technologies and APIs, this project can enhance the procurement workflow within organizations, leading to improved efficiency and accountability.
